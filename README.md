# Snake  
Basic Snake game created with Java  
Grabbing a red square will increase the length of the snake. Gather as many as you can without touching the edge of the screen or your own tail.
WASD to move. ENTER to increase the length of the snake.

To play, simply download the .jar file and run, or clone the repo and assemble your own .jar file if you are (rightfully) at odds with running some random dev's executable.
